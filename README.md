# Discord Radio Bot

This Discord bot streams a radio station, provides now-playing information, and allows users to connect, disconnect, and move the bot between voice channels. It fetches song metadata and displays it in an embedded message.

## Features

- **Connect** to a voice channel and stream a radio station: `$connect`
- **Disconnect** the bot from the voice channel: `$disconnect`
- **Move** the bot between voice channels: `$move`
- **Check bot latency**: `$ping`
- **Now Playing**: Display the currently playing song, album, and artist.

## Requirements

You need to have Python 3.12 installed (recommended via Microsoft Store), along with the following libraries:

- `discord.py==2.4.0`
- `PyNaCl==1.5.0`
- `yt-dlp==2024.10.22`

These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation.

## Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
2. Under the application, create a bot and enable `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT`.
3. Copy the bot token and replace `YOUR-BOT-TOKEN` in `Radio.py`.
4. Install `ffmpeg` and add it to `Environment Variables`.
5. Install the required dependencies (CMD):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the bot (CMD):
   ```bash
   python Radio.py
   ```

## Note

This bot streams only one radio station: [107.7 Pulse FM (CISF FM)](https://listen.streamon.fm/cisffm).  
Currently, it only supports a single server, but multi-server functionality may be added in the future.  
If you encounter any bugs, feel free to reach out, and I'll work to resolve them.
